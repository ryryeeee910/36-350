Hello, Aliens. Welcome to planet Earth. Our planet is made up 7 continents, each
with its own set of unique traits. I am from North America, a landmass with
many different climates and cultures throughout. A continent like Africa,
however, has a much warmer climate and different wildlife. Each continent has
its own personality, so I encourage you to visit each one during your stay.
The best way to get to know planet Earth is to explore for yourselves! I have
a few questions for you, however. What planet do you all come from? How is it
different from what you have seen so far of planet Earth? Finally, could you 
take me there? I'd love to see what makes you all special.
